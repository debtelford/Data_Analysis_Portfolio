# Deborah Telford - Data Analysis Portfolio


## About

My background spans accounting and academic research, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, reporting, and statistical reasoning. In 2025, I earned a PhD in Exercise Science, using R to integrate and analyse accelerometry and questionnaire data to explore how adolescents sleep, sit, stand, and move throughout the 24-hour day and how these behaviors relate to health and wellbeing. I’m now expanding this expertise through projects in Python, SQL, and Power BI, with a particular focus on applying data analysis in health and social contexts.
