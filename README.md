# Deborah Telford - Data Analysis Portfolio


## About

This repository illustrates a selection of my data analysis projects.
My background spans accounting and research, where I built a strong foundation in data analysis, reporting, and statistical reasoning. I completed a PhD in Exercise Science (2025), using R to integrate and analyse accelerometry and questionnaire data to understand how adolescents sleep, sit, stand, and move throughout the 24-hour day, and how these behaviours relate to health and wellbeing.

I’m now applying these analytical skills across new tools and contexts.
This repo is a space to share work-in-progress, explore new methods, and demonstrate my approach to data-driven problem-solving.


## Status (20/11/25):
- Power BI, SQL and R folders contain samples of work.
- Python folder - to be updated.
