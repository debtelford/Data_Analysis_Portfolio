# Deborah Telford - Data Analysis Portfolio


## About

My background spans accounting and academic research, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, reporting, and statistical reasoning. In 2025, I completed a PhD in Exercise Science, using R to process and analyse accelerometry and questionnaire data. I’m now building on that experience through projects in Python, SQL, and Power BI, with a particular interest in applying data analysis within health and social contexts.
